# Overview of the Project
## Project: SMART GRID ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## Objective:
         This Arduino-based smart grid energy management system uses a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, an LDR for light levels, and a relay to control high-power devices. It monitors environmental conditions to simulate energy demand-response and grid balancing. The system outputs real-time data and status updates via the serial monitor.
## Keyfeature:
### Temperature and Humidity Measurement:
                    Collect temperature and humidity data using the DHT11 sensor.
### Light Level Measurement:
                     Measure ambient light intensity with the LDR.
### Relay Control:
              Activate or deactivate the relay based on temperature readings to simulate energy demand.
### LED Indication:
              Use an LED to visually indicate the relay's status.
### Delay Management:
              Implement delays between readings to manage the system's response time.

## Software used:
              Wokwi Iot stimulation
